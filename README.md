# SmartPills
This repo hosts an Android application I developped in 2021 as part of my application project at Télécom Paris (PACT).
The app is written in Java using Android Studio. It might not work as of now due to config issues.

## The SmartPills app
The app is designed to remote manage pill boxes for eleder people ("SmartPills"). It is connected to a FireBase Authentification and Storage as backend.
